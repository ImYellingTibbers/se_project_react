# 🌦️ What to Wear - Weather-Based Outfit Suggestions

## 🏗️ Project Overview

**What to Wear** is a **full-stack web application** that provides weather-based clothing recommendations. Built using **React + Vite** for the frontend and **Express + MongoDB** for the backend, it dynamically fetches weather data and displays user-customized outfit suggestions.

This is my first full-stack React project, combining my knowledge of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and new skills in **frontend-backend integration, user authentication**, and **RESTful APIs**.
